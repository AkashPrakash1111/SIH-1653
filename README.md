## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
1. **Nearest Interview Facility Locator**: Use Geocoding AI to help candidates locate nearby interview centers or virtual interview hubs based on their current location. Implement a map-based interface to display interview centers, provide directions, contact details, and availability status. For virtual interviews, suggest the nearest internet centers or co-working spaces with high-speed connectivity.

2. **Virtual Interview Assistant**: Offer a virtual assistant to guide candidates and interviewers through the interview process. Provide step-by-step guidance on interview preparation, including technical and managerial tips. Offer real-time suggestions to interviewers for follow-up questions based on candidate responses. Include a feature to securely wipe sensitive data (e.g., mock interview recordings) after the session.

3. **Image Recognition for Resume and Document Verification**: Use image recognition AI to verify and categorize candidate documents (e.g., resumes, certificates, IDs) uploaded during the application process. Automatically extract and validate information from uploaded documents, flag discrepancies or missing information for review, and categorize documents based on type (e.g., educational, professional, identity proof). This streamlines the document verification process, saving time and reducing errors.

4. **Real-Time Relevance Scoring System**: Implement an AI-driven system to evaluate the relevance of both questions and responses during the interview. Develop a web-based platform with integrated NLP capabilities to assess the relevance of questions and responses in real-time. Display scores and feedback on a dashboard for both interviewers and candidates. This enhances objectivity and ensures a quantifiable evaluation process.

5. **Real-Time Analytics Dashboard for Interviewers and Admins**: Provide a comprehensive dashboard for interviewers and administrators to track and analyze interview performance. Develop a web-based analytics dashboard using frameworks like React.js or Angular to display real-time metrics such as question relevance, response quality, and candidate engagement. Generate post-interview reports with detailed insights into candidate performance. This enables data-driven decision-making and continuous improvement of the recruitment process.
